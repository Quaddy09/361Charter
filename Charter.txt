Friday 5pm-9pm

Response time to communication expectations

Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
LL: 
accomplishes task, tested/checked, refactored and submitted to github (if code) 

Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
LL: 
format - Discord?   frequency - three times a week? (the minimum he gave us)
meeting minutes - make a shared document (Docs, Word, etc) in which to put the minutes, type them in as we go along
Update taskboard as we go (I actually have a Google Jamboard set up that I thought we could use for this - or not, whatever works)

Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
LL: 
propose to group, put it to a vote (needs at least 4 out of 6 to pass)
if accepted, add onto bottom of charter so that we have a running record of the group's policies

Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
LL:
1. Message/ping them with reminders encouraging them to do what they should be doing
2. Discuss their behavior with them in the next meeting and come up with strategies on how to get them back on track
-- If necessary, at this point, the group can start reassigning their parts (especially those that others need to get done in order to progress) --
3. Email member, with everyone in the group CC'ed, reiterating what they're doing (or not doing) that doesn't meet expectations [both as a reminder and as documentation]

Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
