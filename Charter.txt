Group 3

Avaliablity of meetings:
For discord calls:
M-F 6pm-9pm

If you do need me for anything outside of those hours, send me a message. I tend to respond quickly. At the latest, it should be at the end of the day.

Response Time:
Preferrably respond as soon as you can, but at the latest should be 2 business days.

Definition of done:
you should make a pull request of your changes. That way we are able to see what you have done and effectively track your progress on your tasks 
and decide together if the task is done

Scrum Meeting Format:
I think meetings should generally be about an hour long. Most meetings I've had don't really meet that mark, so I think that's a good time period
Members should go over what they did and then what's troubling them or preventing them from working. From there we can redistribute tasks if need be.

Adopting policies:
Not really sure about this yet. I think at the very least we need to discuss it and how it would benefit us during the development process.

If member is not meeting expectations:
We need to contact them first and see what's up. If there is no response after 2 days, we need to schedule a meeting with the rest of the group to
redistirbute tasks and decide how to "motivate" the member.
