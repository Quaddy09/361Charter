David Krisna:
  All of the group member agreed with what we have. 
  Made sure that at least 2 person have a comment about the code.
  Made sure to make changes (pull req).

Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
John Schiltz:
  Updated your task as soon as it is updatable / before meetings
  Bi-weekly meeting 30min-45min. anything over 45 minutes usually gets unproductive. 
  Meetings should go over each person, checking on what they've done since the last meeting if they are stuck on anything if there is anything they need from us to move forward.

David Krisna:
  Keep the files up to date.

Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
John Schiltz:
  Propose at meeting. Vote with majority? IDK
  CI with auto-formatting, 2 required reviewers for check-in. Updated documentation when you finish a module/class/method


Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
John Schiltz:
  Schedule a meeting to go over any roadblocks they are running into. 
  Try to set clear directives on what needs to be done.
  At the next scrum meeting, mby try to move around tasks to fit what the member is capable of 
  After that, it is their job to get things done.
  
David Krisna:
 - Made sure to have a separate meeting to make sure everything is up to date/discuss some problem that 
   might have encountered.
 - Try to shift the workload towards members evenly.
 - Made sure that the other member knows what to do for each task.
